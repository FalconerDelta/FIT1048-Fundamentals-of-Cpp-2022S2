~~~~~~The Treasure Caverns of Doom~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are a brave adventurer, the King assigned you to get 5 artefacts to craft the cure for the princess. 
You have to travel through the cave system and fight for it. 
You have limited time to move around the caves, when to take profit and rest for the next adventure, itâ€™s your choice. Make your decision wisely.

You could do the following actions in the game:

e[X]amine         : If no monsters are in the cavern, you may search for treasure using [X]. 
                    There are chances of finding a few gold coins or a small gem, as well as finding some other item (not an artefact). 
                    This will consume oil from your lantern, but it may prove to be time well spent, or not.
[A]ttack          : If a monster is in the cavern you can choose to attack it using [A]. 
                    If you decide to attack, the combat sequence will activate, with you winning or losing at the end of the battle sequence.
[F]lee            : If you choose not the engage in combat, you can flee using [F]. 
                    However, you will automatically take the minimum damage that monster would inflict in combat.
[N], [S], [E], [W]: If there is nothing in the cavern, perhaps after you have searched it, you can use one of the compass directions listed. 
                    You will not be able to go in a direction that is not listed. Moving also reduces your lantern oil by 2-5 points.
[P]rovisions      : Allows you to eat one of your provisions which restores some of your health. 
                    If you have also collected potions you can drink one to gain its benefits or other effects!
[T]ake and [D]rop : Add and remove things from your inventory. 
[M]ap             : Open your map.
[H]elp            : Show this how to play dialog.
[Q]uit            : Exit the game.
